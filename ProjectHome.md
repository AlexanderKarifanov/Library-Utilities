The LANDIS Modeling Utility Library originated from the [LANDIS-II project](http://www.landis-ii.org).  LANDIS-II is a forest landscape simulation model.  This library provides the basic functionality for model applications:

  * reading input parameter from text files,
  * random number generation,
  * loading application plug-ins, and
  * helper classes and methods for working with basic data types (string, boolean, percentage, etc).
